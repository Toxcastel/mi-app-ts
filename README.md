## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This is the main script

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Notes

Custom hooks: being able to create these ones would help me reuse code in a fashionable way. f.e: I don't need to repeat form code if I have multiple forms to create
